# gallery
little test task
(an application that loads images and presents them in a collage-like fashion (calculate the optimal layout based on each imageâ€™s aspect ratio to obtain the minimal unused screen space). After an image is clicked, it fades-out and is removed from the collage and another image is loaded, fades-in, and the layout is updated.)
